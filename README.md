# House Prices Prediction 

## Introduction
House Price Prediction is a crucial part of understanding and managing the real estate market. This project aims to analyze and predict house prices based on factors such as area, number of bedrooms, and other characteristics of the house.

Understanding the value of these factors not only helps buyers and sellers make smarter decisions but also helps investors identify potential investment opportunities and minimize risks.

The project uses data from Kaggle[[1]](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harishkumardatalab/housing-price-prediction/data) and applies data analysis methods as well as machine learning models to analyze and predict house prices. The analysis results will provide insights into the factors affecting house prices and help stakeholders make more accurate decisions in choosing to buy a house.
